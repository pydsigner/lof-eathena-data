This repository is a fork of git://github.com/Pihro/lof-eathena-data.git ,
which contains server-side data for running a game based on The Mana World
called Land of Fire.

Many quests are broken and many scripts need updating to run on newer
versions of TMW's server software, called tmwAthena. I am working on both
through the following changes:

* Massive bug fixes to quest data
* Minor updates to items_db and mobs_db to make them work on newer servers
* Import new mobs and items from TMW
* Import new functions from TMW
* Ensure that everything is in place for a *potential* content-sync with TMW

If you are interested in helping, I go by the name Itchy Demon in LoF and
Piki on Freenode IRC. In addition, you may join #landoffire on Freenode to
discuss in real-time with other LoF contributors on what needs done, and you
may find a list of current (known) bugs on the LoF forum at:

P.S. I am not an admin or GM, I have no special powers within the LoF project
     other than knowing how to fix bugs, so please don't ask me for anything!
     Content requests should be posted to the forum or sent to the admins on
     IRC or in-game.
